bottomless margaritas
punch his skull out of his face
i don't like you in that way
parent teacher conference
all good things come to an end
rock and roll fantasy camp
from hells heart, I stab at thee
something wicked this way comes
inappropriate grandpa
sasquatch made me these pancakes
can anyone fly this thing
whiskey is the solution
sudo make me a sandwich
held together by waffles
duct tape my heart together
throw a bag over those wounds
that's just my service tumor
random acts of violence
the sound of one hand clapping
everybody was kung fu
